To run the app locally a few command should be given:
$ bundle install
$ rake db:migrate
$ rake beers:seed_beers

The google maps api and the highcharts chart do not work in heroku, however they do work locally

The application can be tested with '$ rspec'

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
